## API Authentication and Authorization

There are only two requests which don't require authorization headers.

#### Authenticate (login)

```http

```

Request body example:

```json

After running the authenticate request, the client will obtain an access token that will be used in all subsequent request in order to authenticate the user and to authorize the user based on its role.

This is an example of what should be included in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNjcxMTQzMzEyfQ.dxIzsD9Bm8y_kw3MOoZ2JXIKOg--uZaA5XNtBLdGYc4Ps3nlzBFDwBJi0bEeHlCggonZ6nQ2zwCI0D5a7dXjmw

## Usage/Examples

You can use a demo version of the app, using SwaggerUI and following this link:

```javascript
https://obscure-peal.heroku.app/swagger-ui/
``` 
First, obtain an access token by running the /authenticate endpoint with username "user" and password "pass", which will grant you admin rights in the application.

From now on, you can use all other available endpoints, as per swagger documentation.



## Roadmap

In the future, application can be extended with following:

- To see what the prices are for the rooms during the holidays 
- To put the city(when I add hotel) where the hotel is and to  see what tourist attractions I could visit in the city where the hotel is located
